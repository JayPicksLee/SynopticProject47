            h2 About Pu Ngaol
            p Pu Ngaol is home primarily to the Bunong people, Mondulkiri's largest indigenous group. Their ancestors have been known to live in this area of Cambodia for over 2,000 years, with their culture and language deeply rooted in the country’s natural landscape. It is also home to Khmer families, who make up the majority of the population in Cambodia. The majority of people living in Pu Ngaol, practise a subsistence lifestyle meaning everything they need to survive comes from the forest or fields nearby, and have honed responsible resource and agricultural practices over time. They live in balance with the land to ensure it is preserved for the future and play a key role in maintaining and caring for local environments and ecosystems.
